<h2>The True Religion of God</h2><br>
<center><strong>By Dr. Abu Ameenah Bilal Philips</strong></center>

<p><strong>Which Is The True Religion Of God?</strong><br><br>
Each person is born in a circumstance which is not of his own choosing. The religion of his
family or the ideology of the state is thrust upon him from the very beginning of his existence
in this world. By the time he reaches his teens, he is usually fully brain-washed into believing
that the beliefs of his particular society are the correct beliefs that everyone should have.
However, when some people mature and are exposed to other belief-systems, they begin to
question the validity of their own beliefs. The seekers of truth often reach a point of confusion
upon realizing that each and every religion, sect, ideology and philosophy claims to be the one
and only correct way for man. Indeed, they all encourage people to do good. So, which one is
right? They cannot all be right since each claims all others are wrong. Then how does the
seeker of truth choose the right way?
</p>

<p>God gave us all minds and intellects to enable us to make this crucial decision. It is the most
important decision in the life of a human being. Upon it depends his future, Consequently,
each and every one of us must examine dispassionately the evidence presented and choose
what appears to be right until further evidence arises</p>

<p>Like every other religion or philosophy, Islam also claims to be the one and only true way to
God. In this respect it is no different from other systems. This booklet intends to provide some
evidence for the validity of that claim. However, it must always be kept in mind that one can
only determine the true path by putting aside emotions and prejudices, which often blind us to
reality. Then, and only then, will we be able to use our God-given intelligence and make a
rational and correct decision.</p>

<p>There are several arguments, which may be advanced to support Islam’s claim to be the true
religion of God. The following are only three of the most obvious. The first argument is based on
the divine origin of the names of the religion and the comprehensiveness of its meaning. The
second deals with the unique and uncomplicated teachings concerning the relationship
between God, man, and creation. The third argument derives from the fact that Islam is
universally attainable by all men at all times. These are the three basic components of what
logic and reason dictate necessary for a religion to be considered the true religion of God. The
following pages will develop these concepts in some detail.</p>

<p><strong>The Religion’s Name</strong><br><br>
The first thing that one should know and clearly understand about Islam is what the word
‘Islam” itself means. The Arabic word “Islam” means the submission or surrender of one’s will
to the only true God, known in Arabic as “Allah”. One who submits his will to God is termed in
Arabic a “Muslim”. The religion of Islam is not named after a person or a people, nor was it
decided by a later generation of man, as in the case of Christianity which was named after
Jesus Christ, Buddhism after Gautama Buddha, Confucianism after Confucius, Marxism after
Karl Marx, Judaism after the tribe of Judah and Hinduism after the Hindus. Islam (submission
to the will of God) is the religion which was given to Adam, the first man and the first prophet
of God, and it was the religion of all the prophets sent by Allah to mankind. Further its name
was chosen by God Himself and clearly mentioned in the final scripture which He revealed to
man. In that final revelation, called in Arabic the Qur’an Allah states the following:
</p>

<p><em>“This day have I perfected your religion for you,
completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for
you Islam as your religion.” [Qur’an 5:3]<br><br>
“If anyone desires a religion other than Islam
(submission to God), never will it be accepted of
Him.” [Qur’an 3:85]</em></p>

<p>Hence, Islam does not claim to be a new religion brought by Prophet Mohammed into Arabia in
the seventh century, but rather to be a re-expression in its final form of the true religion of
Almighty God, Allah, as it was originally revealed to Adam and subsequent prophets.
</p>

<p>At this point we might comment briefly on two other religions that claim to be the true path.
Nowhere in the Bible will you find God revealing to Prophet Moses’ people or their descendants
that their religion is called Judaism, or to the followers of Christ that their religion is called
Christianity. In other words, the names “Judaism” and “Christianity” had no divine origin or
approval. It was not until long after his departure that the name Christianity was given to
Jesus’ religion.</p>

<p>What, then, was Jesus’ religion in actual fact, as distinct from its name? (Both the name Jesus
and the name Christ are derived from Hebrew words, through Greek and Latin. Jesus is the
English and Latin form of the Greek Iesous, which in Hebrew Is Yeshua or Yehoshua’ (Joshua).
The Greek word Christos is a translation of the Hebrew [for] 'messiah', which is a title meaning
'the anointed'.) His religion was reflected in his teachings, which he urged his followers to
accept as guiding principles in their relationship with God. In Islam, Jesus is a prophet sent by
Allah and his Arabic name is Eesa. Like the prophets before him, he called upon the people to
surrender their will to the will of God (which is what Islam stands for). For example, in the New
Testament it is stated that Jesus taught his followers to pray to God as follows:
</p>


<p><em>“Our father in heaven, hallowed be your name, may your
will be done on earth as it is in heaven.” [Luke
11:2/Matthew 6:9-10]
</em></p>

<p>This concept was emphasised by Jesus in a number of his statements recorded in the Gospels.
He taught, for example, that only those who submitted would inherit paradise. Jesus also
pointed out that he himself submitted to the will of God.
</p>

<p><em>“None of those who call me ‘Lord’ will enter the kingdom
of God, but only the one who does the will of my Father
in heaven.” [Matthew 7:21]<br>
“I cannot do anything of myself I judge as I hear and my
judgment is honest because I am not seeking my own
will but the will of Him who sent me.” [John 5:30]
</em></p>

<p>There are many reports in the Gospels which show that Jesus made it clear to his followers
that he was not the one true God. For example, when speaking about the final Hour, he said:
</p>

<p><em>“No-one knows about the day or hour, not even the
angels in heaven, not the son, but only the Father.”
[Mark 13:32]
</em></p>

<p>Thus, Jesus like the prophets before him and the one who came after him, taught the religion
of Islam: <strong>submission to the will of the one true God.</strong>
</p>

<p><strong>God And Creation</strong><br><br>
Since the total submission of one’s will to God represents the essence of worship, the basic
message of God’s divine religion, Islam, is the worship of God alone. It also requires the
avoidance of worship directed to any person, place or thing other than God. Since everything
other than God, the creator of all the things, is God’s creation, it may be said that Islam, in
essence, calls man away from worship of creation and invites him to worship only his Creator.
He is the only one deserving of man’s worship, because it is only by His will that prayers are
answered.</p>

<p>Accordingly, if a man prays to a tree and his prayers are answered, it is not the tree which
answers his prayers but God, who allows the circumstances prayed for to take place. One
might say, “That is obvious”. However, to tree-worshippers, it might not be so. Similarly,
prayers to Jesus, Buddha, or Krishna or Saint Christopher, or Saint Jude or even to
Muhammad, are not answered by them, but are answered by God. Jesus did not tell his
followers to worship him but to worship God, as the Quran states:
</p>

<p><em>“And behold! Allah will say: ‘O Jesus, the son of
Mary! Did you say to men, worship me and my
mother as gods besides Allah?, He will say: “Glory to
you, I could never say what I had no right (to say).”
[Qur’an 5:118]</em></p>

<p>Nor did Jesus worship himself when he worshipped, but rather he worshipped God. And Jesus
was reported in the Gospels to have said,</p>

<p><em>“It is written: 'Worship the Lord your God and serve Him
only.’” [Luke 4:8]
</em></p>


<p>This basic principle is contained in the opening chapter of the Qur’an, known as Soorah alFaatihah,
verse 4:
</p>

<p><em>“you alone do we worship and from you alone do we
seek help.”
</em></p>

<p>Elsewhere, in the final book of revelation, the Quran, God also said:
</p>

<p><em>“And you Lord says: ‘Call on Me and I will answer
your (prayer).’” [Qur’an 40:60]</em></p>

<p>It is worth emphasizing that the basic message of Islam (namely, the worship of God alone) also
proclaims that God and His creation are distinctly different entities. God is neither equal to His
creation nor a part of it, nor is His creation equal to Him or a part of Him.
</p>

<p>This might seem obvious, but man’s worship of creation, instead of the Creator is to a large
degree based on ignorance, or neglect, of this concept. It is the belief that the essence of God is
everywhere in His creation or that His divine being is or was present in some parts of His
creation, which has provided justification for the worship of God’s creation and naming it the
worship of God. However, the message of Islam, as brought by the prophets of God, is to
worship only God and to avoid the worship of His creation either directly or indirectly.
</p>
<p>In the Qur’an God clearly states:</p>
<p><em>“For we assuredly sent amongst every people a
prophet, with the command Worship Me and avoid
false Gods.” [Qur’an 16:36]
</em></p>

<p>When idol worshippers are questioned as to why they bow down to idols created by men, the
invariable reply is that they are not actually worshipping the stone image, but God who is
present within it. They claim that the stone idol is only a focal point for God’s essence and is
not in itself God! One who has accepted the concept of God being present in any way within His
creation will be obliged to accept this argument for idolatry. Whereas, one who understands the
basic message of Islam and its implications would never agree to idolatry no matter how it is
rationalized.</p>

<p>Those who have claimed divinity for themselves down through the ages have often based their
claims on the mistaken belief that God is present in man. Taking one step further, they claim
that God is more present in them than in the rest of us, and that other humans should therefore submit to them and worship them as God in person or as God concentrated within their persons. Similarly, those who have asserted the godhood of others after their deaths have found fertile ground among those who accept the false belief of God’s presence in man.</p>

<p>It should be abundantly clear by now that one who has grasped the basic message of Islam and
its implications could never agree to worship another human being under any circumstance.
God’s religion, in essence, is a clear call to the worship of the Creator and the rejection of
creation-worship in any form. This is the meaning of the motto of Islam:</p>

<h2>“Laa Ilaaha Ill Allah” (there is no God but Allah)</h2>


<p>The sincere declaration of this phrase and the acceptance of prophethood automatically bring
one within the fold of Islam, and sincere belief in it guarantees one Paradise. Thus, the final
Prophet of Islam (p.b.u.h) is reported to have said, <strong>“Any one who says: There is no God but
Allah, and dies holding that (belief) will enter paradise.”</strong>
</p>

<p>Belief in this declaration of faith requires that one submit his/her will to God in the way taught
by the prophets of God. It also requires the believer to give up the worship of false gods.
</p>

<p><strong>The Message Of False Religions</strong><br><br>
There are so many sects, cults, religions, philosophies, and movements in the world, all of
which claim to be the right way or the only true path of God How can one determine which one
is correct or whether, in fact, all are correct? One method by which the answer can be found is
to clear away the superficial differences in the teachings of the various claimants to the
ultimate truth, and identifies the central object of worship upon which they call, directly or
indirectly. False religions all have in common one basic concept with regard to God they either
claim that all men are gods, or that specific men were God, or that nature is God, or that God
is a figment of man’s imagination.</p>

<p>Thus, it may be stated that the basic message of false religion is that God may be worshipped
in the form of His creation. False religions invite man to the worship of creation by calling the
creation or some aspect of it God. For example, prophet Jesus invited his followers to worship
God, but those who claim to be Jesus’ followers today call people to worship Jesus, claiming
that he was God.
</p>

<p>Buddha was a reformer who introduced a number of humanistic principles in the religion of
India. He did not claim to be God, nor did he suggest to his followers that he be an object of
worship. Yet today most Buddhists who are to be found outside of India have taken him to be
God and they prostrate themselves to idols made in their perception of his likeness.</p>

<p>By using the principle of identifying the object of worship, we can easily detect false religions
and the contrived nature of their origin. As God said in the Qur’an:
</p>

<p><em>“That which you worship besides Him are only names
and you and your forefathers have invented for
which Allah has sent down no authority: the
command belongs only to Allah He has command
that you worship Him; that is the right religion, but
most men do not understand.” [Qur’an 12:40]
</em></p>

<p>It may be argued that all religions teach good things, so why should it matter which one we
follow? The reply is that all false religions teach the greatest evil the worship of creation.
Creation-worship is the greatest sin that man can commit because it contradicts the very
purpose of his creation. Man was created to worship God alone as Allah has explicitly stated in
the Qur’an:</p>

<p><em>“I have only created jinns and men, that they may
worship Me” [Qur’an 51:56]</em></p>

<p>Consequently , the worship of creation, which is the essence of idolatry is the only unforgivable
sin. One who dies in this state of idolatry, has sealed his fate in the next life. This is not an
opinion, but a revealed fact stated by God in his final revelation to man:
</p>
<p><em>“Verily Allah will not forgive the joining of partners
with Him, but He may forgive (sins) less than that for
whomsoever He wishes.” [Qur’an 4:48 and 116]</em></p>

<p><strong>Universality Of God’s Religion</strong><br><br>
Since the consequences of following a false religion are so grave, the true religion of God must
have been universally understandable and universally attainable in the past and it must
continue eternally to be understandable and attainable throughout the entire world. In other
words, the true religion of God cannot be confined to any one people, place, or period of time.
Nor is it logical that such a religion should impose conditions that have nothing to do with the
relationship of man with God, such as baptism, or belief in man as a savior, or an
intermediary. Within the central principle of Islam and its definition (the surrender of one’s will
to God) lie the roots of Islam’s universality. Whenever man comes to the realization that God is
one and distinct from His creation, and submits himself to God, he becomes a Muslim in body
and spirit and is eligible for paradise.
</p>

<p>Consequently, anyone at any time in the most remote regions of the world can become Muslim,
a follower of God’s religion, Islam, by merely rejecting the worship of creation and turning to
God alone. It should be noted, however, that in order to actually submit to God’s will, one must
continually choose between right and wrong. Indeed, man is endowed by God with the power
not only to distinguish right from wrong but also to choose between them. These God-given
powers carry with them an important responsibility, namely, that man is answerable to God for
the choices he makes. It follows, then, that man should try his utmost to do good and avoid
evil. These concepts are expressed in the final revelation as follows:</p>

<p><em>“Verily, those who believe (in the Qur’an), and those
who follow the Jewish faith, and the Christians, and
the Sabians (angel-and-star-worshippers) -- any of
these who believe in Allah and the Last Day and work
righteousness shall have their reward with their
Lord. They will not be overcome by fear or grief.”
[Qur’an 2:62]</em></p>

<p>If, for whatever reason, they fail to accept the final message after it has been clearly explained
to them, they will be in grave danger. The last Prophet said:
</p>

<p><em>“Whoever among the Christians and Jews hears of me but
does not affirm his belief in what I brought and dies in
this state will be among the inhabitants of hell.” (Sahih
Muslim [English Translation], Vol.1 P.91 No, 284)
</em></p>

<p><strong>Recognition Of God</strong><br><br>
The question which arises here is : How can all people be expected to believe in the one true
God, given their varying backgrounds, societies and cultures? For people to be held responsible
for worshipping the one true God, they all need to have access to knowledge of Him. The final
revelation teaches that all humans being have the recognition of the one true God imprinted on
their souls as a part of their very nature with which they are created.
</p>

<p>In the seventh chapter of the Qur’an (Al-A’raaf, verses 172-173), God explained that when He
created Adam He caused all of Adam’s descendants to come into existence and He took a
pledge from them saying:</p>

<p><em>“‘Am I not your Lord?’ To which they all replied,
‘Yes, we testify to it’”
</em></p>

<p>Allah then explained why He had all of mankind bear witness that He is their creator and the
only true God worthy of worship. He said:</p>

<p>“That was in case you (mankind) should say on the
day of Resurrection, ‘Verily we were unaware of all
this’” [Qur’an 7:172]
</p>

<p>That is to say, we cannot claim on that day that we had no idea that Allah, was our God and
that no one told us that we were only supposed to worship Allah alone. Allah went on to further
explain that:</p>

<p><em>“It was also in case you should say, ‘Certainly it was
our ancestors who made partners (with Allah) and we
are only their descendants; will you then destroy us
for what those liars did?’” [Qur’an 7:173]
</em></p>

<p>Thus, every child is born with a natural belief in God and an in-born inclination to worship
Him alone. This in-born belief and inclination is called in Arabic the <strong>“Fitrah“</strong>.
</p>

<p>The Prophet Muhammad reported that Allah said, <strong>“I created my servants in the right
religion, but devils made them go astray.”</strong> The Prophet also said, <strong>“Each child is born in a
state of Fitrah. Then his parents make him a Jew, Christian or a Zoroastrian.” </strong>If the child
were left alone, he would worship God in his own way, but all children are affected by the
environment. So, just as the child submits to the physical laws, which Allah has imposed on
nature, in the same way his soul also submits naturally to the fact that Allah is his Lord and
Creator. But, if his parents try to make him follow a different path, the child is not strong
enough in the early stages of his life to resist or oppose the will of his parents. In such cases,
the religion, which the child follows, is one of custom and upbringing, and God does not hold
him to account or punish him for his religion up to a certain stage of his life.
</p>

<p><strong>The Signs Of God</strong><br><br>
Throughout people’s lives, from childhood until the time they die, signs of the one and only
true God are shown to them in all regions of the earth and in their own souls, until it becomes
clear that there is only one true God (Allah). God says in the Qur’an:
</p>

<p><em>“We will show them our signs In the furthest regions
(of the earth) and in their souls, until it becomes
clear to them that this is the truth.” [Qur’an 41:53]
</em></p>

<p>The following is an example of God revealing by a sign to one man the error of his idol-worship.
In the south-eastern region of the Amazon jungle in Brazil, South America, a primitive tribe
erected a new hut to house their man-idol Skwatch, representing the supreme God of all
creation. The following day a young man entered the hut to pay homage to the God, and while
he was in prostration to what he had been taught was his Creator and Sustainer, a mangy old
flea-ridden dog slunk into the hut. The young man looked up in time to see the dog lift his hind
leg and pass urine on the idol.</p>

<p>Outraged, the youth chased the dog out of the temple; but when his rage died down he realized
that the idol could not be the Lord of the Universe. God must be elsewhere, he concluded. As
strange as it may seem, the dog urinated on the idol was a sign from God for that young man.
This sign contained the divine message that what he was worshipping was false. It liberated
from slavishly following his traditionally learned worship of a false god. As a result, this man
was given a choice: either to seek the true god or to continue in the error of his ways.
</p>

<p>Allah mentions Prophet Abraham’s quest for God as an example of how those who follow His
signs will be rightly guided:</p>

<p><em>“So also did we show Abraham the power and the
Laws of the heavens and the earth that he might
(with understanding) have certitude. When the night
covered him over, he saw a star. He said: ‘This is my
Lord.’ But when it set, he said: ‘I love not those that
set’ When he saw the moon rising in splendor, he
said: ‘This is my Lord.’ But when the moon set, he
said: ‘Unless my Lord guide me, I shall surely be
among those who go astray.’ When he saw the rising
sun in splendor, he said: ‘This is my Lord this is the
greatest (of all).’ But when the sun set, he said; ‘O
my people I am indeed free from your (guilt) of giving
partners to Allah. For me, I have set my face, firmly
and truly, towards Him who created the heavens and
the earth, and never shall I give partners to Allah”
[Qur’an 6:75-79]
</em></p>

<p>As was mentioned earlier, prophets have been sent to every nation and tribe to support man’s
natural belief in God and man’s in-born inclination to worship Him, as well as to reinforce the
divine truth in the daily signs revealed by God. Although much of these prophets’ teachings
became distorted, portions revealing their God-inspired messages have remained untainted and
have served to guide mankind in the choice between right and wrong. The influence of Godinspired
messages down through the ages can be seen in the “Ten Commandments” of
Judaism’s Torah which were later adopted into Christianity’s teachings, as well as in the
existence of laws against murder, stealing and adultery in most societies throughout the
ancient and modern world.</p>

<p>As a result of God’s signs to mankind through the ages combined with His revelation through
His prophets, all mankind has been given a chance to recognize the one only true God.
</p>

<p>Consequently, every soul will be held accountable for its belief in God and its acceptance of the
true religion of God, namely Islam, which means total submission to the will of Allah.
</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br><br>
The preceding presentation has demonstrated that the name of the religion of Islam expresses
Islam’s most central principle, submission to God, and that the name “Islam” was chosen not
by man, but by God, according to the holy scriptures of Islam. It has also been shown that
Islam alone teaches the uniqueness of God and His attributes and enjoins the worship of God
alone without intermediaries. Finally, due to the divinely instilled inclination of man to worship
God and the signs revealed by God throughout the ages to each individual, Islam may be
achieved by all men at all times.
</p>

<p>In short, the significance of the name Islam (submission to God), Islam’s fundamental
acknowledgment of the uniqueness of God and Islam’s accessibility to all mankind at all times
convincingly support Islam’s claim that from the beginning of time in whatever language it was
expressed, Islam alone has been, and will be the true religion of God.</p>

<p>In conclusion we ask Allah, the exalted, to keep us on the right path to which He has guided
us, and to bestow on us His blessings and mercy, for He is indeed the Most Merciful. Praise be
to Allah, the Lord of the worlds, and peace and blessings be on prophet Muhammad and on all
the prophets of God and their righteous followers.</p>
