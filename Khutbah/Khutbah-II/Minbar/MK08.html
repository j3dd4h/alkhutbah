<h1 class=TitleArabic>لا يا مؤتمر السكان</h1>
<h1 class=TitleEnglish>“No” To The Population Conference</h1>
<hr>

<h2>First Khutbah</h2>

<p>Praise be to Allaah, who created all creatures, decreed their sustenance, distributed their means of livelihood and wrote down their life spans. No person can ever die except that he takes full share of his livelihood and life span.</p>

<p>I praise Him, thank Him, repent to Him and ask Him to forgive me. He made the path clear so that the righteous souls can follow it, and respond to their Lord's call. On the other hand, some souls went astray, preferring their desires to being guided and surrendering to their lusts.</p>

<p>I testify absolutely that there is no god but Allaah, The One, who has no associate. My testification is an absolute certainty; I believe in its essence and follow its duties. I also testify that our master and prophet Muhammed sallallaahu ‘alaihi wasallam is His servant and messenger, who was sent with guidance and the religion of truth (Islam). By following him sallallaahu ‘alaihi wasallam, souls can achieve their hopes both in the worldly existence and in the Hereafter. May peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him, his household, and his companions, who were the best, the purest, the most righteous and the most pious among this nation’s successors and their righteous followers until the day of Judgment.</p>

<p>O People, fear Allaah as He should be feared, and grasp the most trustworthy handhold of your religion. O Muslims, Allaah has honored the Children of Aadam, has carried them on land, sea and in the sky, has provided them with At-Tayyibat (Lawful good things) and has preferred them above all the creation. He has created them with a mark of preference. Mankind, an honored creature who is the only one that Allaah has created deserving of His guidance, and able to achieve His commandments. He is also the only creature that has mind and will,  can control his desires and is able to curb his lusts. Verily the secret of honor and the essence of humanity is the mind, will and acceptance of Allah's legislations.</p>

<p>Without curbing one's lusts, and without being able to estimate what is harmful and what is beneficial while neglecting the guidance of Allaah, man becomes like a wild animal in a jungle.</p>

<p>How often did nations turn away from the guidance of Allaah, surrendering themselves to their lusts and chasing after their desires, resulting in their going astray and eventual demise, as Allaah says which means: "Whosoever follows my guidance, will not lose his way, nor fall into misery. But whosoever turns away from my message, verily for him is a life straitened" (Ta Ha: 123-124).</p>

<p>The current civilization, with its apostates and materialists following this wrong path will be destroyed; they do not believe in Allaah and The Unseen while being unaware of Allaah's Majesty. They surrendered themselves to their minds and they have been enslaved by their machinery and computers. They have planned just for worldly life, forgetting Allaah, His remembrance and due thanks.</p>

<p>Their spoken words and actions seem to say, "O lord, Your estimation is wrong, and Your regulation is incorrect, as the livelihoods are insufficient, our resources are decreasing and the earth is not big enough for us". Glorified and High is Allaah from the great falsehood that the wrongdoers, unbelievers and deniers have said. Allaah asserts which means: “Assuredly the creation of the heavens and the earth is a greater (matter) than the creation of men: yet most men know not” (Ghafir: 57).</p>

<p>Our Lord is the Most Generous; His treasures never run out. He is bestowing by day and night. Livelihood just depends on His will and its distribution depends on His wisdom. He created the earth, blessed it and measured therein its sustenance. He says which means: “.... Then seek ye sustenance from Allah, serve Him, and be grateful to Him: To Him will be your return” (Al-'Ankabut: 17).</p>

<p>Dear brothers, in the next few days there will be a conference. Those who are responsible for it pretend that they love and care for humanity. But it is a conference that is full of apostasy, defends infidelity and fights against Allaah and His commands. As Allaah says, which means: “They have rejected the truth that has come to you...” (Al-Mumtahinah: 1), and also, “They but wish that ye should reject faith, as they do, and thus be on the same footing (as they): So take no friends from their ranks...” (An-Nisa’: 89).</p>

<p>A conference, they claim, deals with the threat of population explosion and warns of the shortage of Allaah's treasures. A conference that asserts that the solutions of human problems are in the spread of absolute licentiousness, approval of sodomy, marriage of homosexuals, and unregulated and illicit sexual intercourse among adults, youth, bachelors and married ones.</p>

<p>It also legitimates having children outside marriage. It encourages sons’ disobedience of their parents and discourages marriage in early ages. It also legalizes all kinds of abortion.</p>

<p>This is a rebellion against all heavenly decrees, noble laws, good manners and sound nature. Moreover, it is gross apostasy and manifest infidelity.</p>

<p>They have called out to one another from everywhere and have gathered in great numbers, and written down and dictated their misguided opinions. They claim that a lower population leads to more development. But this is an incorrect model of society and misleading information. Man is the only creature on earth that has been granted the ability to deal with the issues of development. Although China has the biggest population, it has the most superior developmental rate. Isn’t this against their opinion? Doesn’t this fact defeat their argument?</p>

<p>But Muslims deal with this issue from a more comprehensive and accurate point of view. Seeking the flow of livelihood, procuring good things and enhancing the rates of development were not, and will never be, except through the belief in Allah as The Sustaining Lord and The Ever Wise Creator.  In Him (alone) we put our trust, and to Him (alone) we turn in repentance and to Him (alone) is (our) final return. Among the implications of this belief is to follow Allaah's commandments and avoid His prohibitions, to fulfill the covenant of Allaah and not break His bond. Thereupon, this will lead to submission to Allaah, implementing His legislations, avoiding transgression or oppression, eschewing from usurping other's property unjustly, not practicing usury, giving Zakat and other wealth duties, not cutting off the family relations;  giving full measure and full weight and not wronging people in their  rights, not wasting resources and fortunes which will invoke Allaah's wrath. Not following these decrees leads to wariness in committing great prohibited evil sins, whether openly or secretly, to sins of all kinds, like unrighteous oppression, joining partners (in worship) with Allaah for which He has given no authority, and saying things about Allaah of which you have no knowledge.</p>

<p>These are the implications of belief. Thereupon comes taking Allaah's laws of nature, concerning science and its application, the proper investment, revision of economic policies, development plans, mass media and education programs, and getting the utmost benefits for individuals and groups according to the guiding light of Allaah and the guidance of Islam.
</p>
<p>Actually, the affliction and pestilence is hidden in their polices, not in their persons. Allaah's treasures never run out, but their offending systems (Taghoot) always fail, and they are encircled by their own wicked and tricky plans. This is because the solution does not lie in the punishment of mankind by destroying nations and dealing with human beings as if they are waste matter, and disposing of the excess people as if they were garbage. What an evil (choice) they decide on!</p>

<p>O wise Muslims, the balance between increasing and decreasing human population is subject to Allah's will, wisdom, estimation and to His knowledge.</p>

<p>As Allaah says, which means: ". . . And no female conceives, or lays down (her load), but with His knowledge. Nor is a man long-lived granted length of days, nor is a part cut off from his life but is in a book ....”  (Fatir: 11).</p>

<p>In accordance with these divine laws and Allah's teachings, the Prophet sallallaahu ‘alaihi wasallam referred to killing one's children out of fear, need and want, as one of the greatest sins.</p>

<p>The right of life is guaranteed to all human beings. When the Prophet sallallaahu ‘alaihi wasallam permitted ‘Azl (withdrawal during sexual intercourse). He sallallaahu ‘alaihi wasallam said to the one who asked him sallallaahu ‘alaihi wasallam: "There is no soul to be created till the day of judgment, but it will be" (Bukhaari & Muslim) in another narration “Cut  off during sexual intercourse if you want, she will meet what had been written” (Muslim)  - this is the reality and the correct creed.</p>

<p>Dear brothers, this is one side of the issue, but there is another side and that is the domination of tyrants over the oppressed. They have imposed their trials and wrath upon the poor, weak nations. High handed with their wealth, they have monopolized exports, and then attributed the poverty and need of the developing countries to their being overpopulated. Do they not destroy their surplus of production so that prices remain high?</p>

<p>Aren't their production’s prices always increasing, while the prices of their imports always decrease? They establish unfair treaties with the poor and weak countries, prejudiced to the rich northern countries and their products. Their aid comes burdened with oppressive policies - oppressed with usurious conditions, shackled with restrictions and limitations, that allows no room for development or progress.
On the other hand, they put a strong iron curtain around their new technologies, their means of production and their ways of developing investment.</p>

<p>Besides their crazy arms race, they are spending billions for the sake of weapons production, spreading it, fabricating and expanding wars, destroying political settlements and arranging massacres. We bring up our sons during their childhood, and they people kill them emotionally and spiritually in their manhood.</p>

<p>They have stored arsenals of war so that they can ruin the earth and destroy the crops and livestock many times over. If they would only be satisfied with weapons capable of ruining the whole world just one time, their budgets would then cover all the projects of production and services for the whole world. But no! It is their intense selfishness, unfair distribution and abominable monopoly for what they have and what they can import that they are concerned about. In spite of what has been mentioned before, they boast, command, recommend, and then decide blame on those weak countries as if they are the cause of the development problem.</p>

<p>O Beloved brothers, if you want to know the truth about this, you should know that the high population of the weak and poor countries, especially the Islamic ones, terrifies them, as it has been clearly revealed in their documents. These documents indicate that overpopulation (of Islamic countries) threatens their interests and destroys their security. Included in what they have said, is that their countries’ icecaps melt under the heat of the sun due to the over population of ‘developing countries’. Some of them were more frank saying that, in the future, they will face the danger of “Islamization” (the spread of Islam). The calls of their writers and theorists have been so loud in warning of the imbalance of power between east and west, that they have announced that the productivity of the Islamic countries is more than theirs by multiples, which will lead to the transition of power and authority within no more than a few decades, according to their estimations, statistics and percentages.</p>

<p>Yes brothers, their numbers and birth rates are decreasing so fast that they support families to increase the numbers of the new born. But this will not happen because they have legalized what Allah has prohibited, through His Messengers and His Books. They have legalized adultery, and homosexuality. Most of them become just one of two, either gay or lesbian.</p>

<p>Let those materialists be cursed and humiliated; Allah says, which means: “There is no moving creature on earth but its sustenance dependeth on Allah: He knoweth its resting place and its temporary deposit: All is in clear Record” (Houd: 6), and let those apostates be perished “How many are the creatures that carry not their own sustenance? It is Allah who feeds (both) them and you: for He hears and knows (all things)” (Al ‘Ankabut: 60) . And let those who don't believe in the Unseen to be disgraced and rejected. “Kill not your children for fear of want: We shall provide sustenance for them as well as for you verily the killing of them is a great sin” (Al-Isra': 31).</p>

<p>Let humiliation and misery be for the liberals - as the believing women gave the oath of fidelity to the Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu ‘alaihi wasallam not to commit adultery, not to kill their children and not to slander others, intensively forgoing falsehood (i.e. by fostering illegal children and claiming them to be their husbands’)</p>

<p>Let us be proud of our religion, and adhere to the truth which is from our Lord. Allaah says, which means:  “If the truth had been in accord with their desires, truly the heavens and the earth, and all beings there in would have been ruin...” (Al-M’uminoon: 71). Also, “Say: If ye had control of the treasures of the mercy of my Lord behold, ye would keep them back, for fear of spending them: for man is (ever) niggardly” (Al-Isra': 100), and also, “Or are the treasures of the Lord with them, or have they control over them” (At-Tur: 37).</p>

<p>Nay! Our lord, by Your Majesty let them be failures and losers.</p>

<p>O Allaah! Preserve the religion of Islam and the Muslims, debase infidelity and infidels and disappoint disbelievers, apostates and those who compromise the religion.</p>

<p>O Allaah! Set right the affairs of the Muslims, give them grants and good offsprings in their lives and make them grateful to You and satisfied with Your favors.</p>
