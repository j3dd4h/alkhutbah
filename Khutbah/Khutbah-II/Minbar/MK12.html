<h1 class=TitleArabic>التوسط والتطرف</h1>
<h1 class=TitleEnglish>Moderation And Extremism</h1>
<hr>

<h2>First Khutbah</h2>

<p>Allah Subhanahu Wa Taala says which translates as: "And indeed we made you a moderate and a just nation"(Al-Baqarah: 143).</p>
 
<p>Brothers in faith, Allah has blessed us, the nation of Muhammad (Salla Allahu Alaihi Wa Sallam) to make us the best nation that was sent to testify against people. He honored us by making us a moderate, balanced and just nation with no extravagance or negligence.</p>
 
<p>Allah The Exalted and The Mighty has blessed us, Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama’ah to be a moderate and a just nation above all other pre-existing nations with their Prophets above the different groups within this nation, that is, the Muslim nation. These groups within the Muslim nation have been mentioned by the Prophet (Salla Allahu Alaihi Wa Sallam). He said: "My nation would divide into seventy two groups or sects. All are going to be in hell fire except for one and that is the Jama’ah".</p>
 
<p>In another narration he was asked: "Who are they O Messenger of Allah?” He said: "He who will be upon what I am upon and my companions".</p>
 
<p>Therefore, the moderate and just nation is a praised nation and it will be saved. It is the nation on the straight path fulfilling the commandments of Allah, struggling to remain on the straight path, that which Allah commanded us, to supplicate that he guides us to it in every Rak’at during our prayers.</p>
 
<p>As Allah says which translates as: "Guides us to the straight   path the way of those on whom you have bestowed your grace, not of those who earned your anger nor of those who went astray"(Al-Fatihah: 6-7). This straight path is pure Islam and is what this saved group Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama’ah will follow. The moderate group committed to the religion of Allah.</p>
 
<p>Moderate and just in all its matters, being it, in believing in Prophets and their scholars. They do not exaggerate as the Christian exaggerated in praising their Prophet and their scholars and taking them as Lords besides Allah. Nor do they shun away and desert their Prophets as the Jews did, when they killed their Prophets and killed those who were enjoining good from their people. Rather it is a group who believes in their Prophets and support and follow them with whatever they commanded them.</p>
 
<p>A moderate and a just nation in the issue of the names and attributes of Allah Subhanahu Wa Taala as opposed to those who negate or change the meaning of the names and attributes of Allah Subhanahu Wa Taala and reject whatever Allah describes Himself with or whatever the messenger (Salla Allahu Alaihi Wa Sallam) describes about the Lord. So much so, that some ascribe to the Lord Subhanahu Wa Taala non-existence as for the dead, while others compare Allah to his creation, exalted and high is Allah from what they say. Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama’ah is a moderate and a just group as opposed to these two groups, the group who negates, and the group who compare Allah to His creation. They (Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama’ah) accept and believe in the names and attributes of Allah that He gave to Himself or His messenger (Salla Allahu Alaihi Wa Sallam) described Him with, without negating, comparing, or misinterpreting the names and attributes of Allah. </p>
 
<p>They (Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama’ah) believe, in light of the verse where Allah Subhanahu Wa Taala says which translates as: ''There is nothing like him, and he is the All Hearer the All Seer"(Ash-Shura: 11). Allah Subhanahu Wa Taala says which translates as: "Say, (O Mohammed), He is Allah The One, The Self-Sufficient Master, whom all creatures need. He neither begets nor was He begotten. And there is none like unto Him"(Al-Ikhlaas), and in light of His Subhanahu Wa Taala saying, which translates as: "So put not forward similitudes for Allah"(An-Nahl: 74).</p>
 
<p>They (Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama’ah) are a just and moderate nation in the issue of reward and punishment. Their position is between those who condemn Muslims who commit major sins, eternally to the hellfire; ruling that they leave the fold of Islam as the group of Al Khawarij and Muatazila and the Murjia who say Imaan-faith is merely believing and they make the faith of a sinner just like the faith of Prophets and the faith of Abubakar, Umar and others from the Muhajirun and the Ansar.</p>
 
<p>So the saved group - Al Firqatul Najiyah believe that faith is something that you believe in the heart, say with the tongue and practice in the life and that it increases with performance of acts of worship and decreases with sins.</p>
 
<p>They have hope for the righteous among the Ummah of Muhammad - the nation of the Prophet (Salla Allahu Alaihi Wa Sallam) and fears regarding the consequences of the sinners among the nation of the Prophet (Salla Allahu Alaihi Wa Sallam).</p>
 
<p>They are a moderate group and just group concerning the issues of divine decree and predestination. Therefore, they believe that Allah Subhanahu Wa Taala knows, recorded, and decreed everything.</p>
 
<p>Whatever He wills happens and whatever He does not will does not take place. His servants have free will but this will is subordinate to the will of Allah Subhanahu Wa Taala.</p>
 
<p>Allah Subhanahu Wa Taala says which translates as: "And you cannot wills unless that what Allah wills"(At-Takwir: 29). The messenger (Salla Allahu Alaihi Wa Sallam) said: "Act for each one will be facilitated, to act in accordance to what had been decreed for him".</p>
 
<p>They (Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama’ah) are a moderate group concerning the companions of the messenger (Salla Allahu Alaihi Wa Sallam). They (Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama’ah) are between a group that exaggerates in their love and a group who neglects their rights. They do not exaggerate as the Rafidhah exaggerated regarding the household of the Prophet (Salla Allahu Alaihi Wa Sallam), nor do they neglect the rights of the companions as the Rafidhah neglected the rights of the companions of the messenger (Salla Allahu Alaihi Wa Sallam). Rather they are a group who loves all companions, send peace and blessings upon them, and ask Allah to be please with all of them.</p>
 
<p>They refrain from talking about the controversial issues that took place between the companions. They love the household of the Prophet (Salla Allahu Alaihi Wa Sallam), and send peace and blessing upon them, as they say in their prayers: "O Allah send peace and blessings upon Muhammad and the household of Muhammad".</p>
 
<p>A moderate group in the issue of what is lawful, what is unlawful, and how judgments are made. They make unlawful whatever Allah Subhanahu Wa Taala and His messenger (Salla Allahu Alaihi Wa Sallam) has made unlawful and they make lawful whatever Allah and His messenger (Salla Allahu Alaihi Wa Sallam) has made lawful.</p>
 
<p>They do not permit their rulers and the elite of their community to make lawful what Allah Subhanahu Wa Taala has made unlawful nor do they permit them to make unlawful what Allah Subhanahu Wa Taala has made lawful. They do not rule or judge by anything else other then what Allah has revealed, as the Christians do and those who imitate them.</p>
 
<p>As Allah Subhanahu Wa Taala says which translates as:  "They took their Rabbi's and their Monks to be Lords besides Allah"(At-Tauba: 31).</p>
 
<p>‘Udai Ibnu Hatim Radhiyallahu Anhu reports that he heard the messenger (Salla Allahu Alaihi Wa Sallam) reciting this verse, he said: "I said O Messenger of Allah, we did not worship them". He (Salla Allahu Alaihi Wa Sallam) replied: "Did they not make lawful whatever Allah made unlawful and you obeyed them? And did they not make lawful whatever Allah Subhanahu Wa Taala made unlawful and you followed them?" I replied "Yes" he (Salla Allahu Alaihi Wa Sallam) said: "This is how you worshiped them".</p>
 
<p>Another supporting evidence to the previously mentioned verse and Hadith is Allah Subhanahu Wa Taala saying regarding issues of making lawful or unlawful, which translates as: "And if you obey them, you have worshiped them"(Al-Aa'am: 121).</p>
 
<p>They (Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama’ah) are a moderate group in the issue of worship. They do not exceed the limits and the boundaries that were legislated by the messenger (Salla Allahu Alaihi Wa Sallam) nor do they neglect certain aspects of worship. They are followers not innovators, they are without exaggeration or negligence.</p>
 
<p>Concerning wealth and how they earn and spend, they do not waste wealth nor are they miserly. As Allah Subhanahu Wa Taala says which translates as: "And those who when they spend are neither extravagant nor miserly, but hold a medium ways between these two extremes"(Al-Furqan: 67).</p>
 
<p>It is reported that Abdul Malik Ibnu Marwan, may Allah has mercy upon him, when he gave his daughter Fatimah to Umar Ibnu Abdulaziz, he said to him: "How do you spend?" He replied:  "Moderately between two extremes".</p>
 
<p>After all that has been said respected brothers, we know that good, all good is in maintaining and adhering to the way of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama’ah. The moderate and just way, that is preserved and protected from all dangers. For the more, a person is just and moderate the more he is preserved and protected from danger.</p>
 
<p>The more he strays away from being moderate and just path the more endangered he becomes, subject to the traps of Satan and subject to following callers to misguidance.</p>
 
<p>The messenger of Allah (Salla Allahu Alaihi Wa Sallam) spoke the truth when he said   in the Hadith found in the book of Al Imam Abu Dawood: "The wolf only eats the lone sheep".</p>
 
 
<p>So, fear Allah O Servants of Allah and protect yourselves by maintaining this way. The moderate way, and imitate the characteristics of this group to be in the category that was mentioned in the saying of the Prophet (Salla Allahu Alaihi Wa Sallam) "What I am upon today and my companions", and his saying, "A group of my Ummah" and in another narration. "My Ummah will continue to maintain themselves on the truth and they will be victorious and will be supported and it will not harm them, those who oppose them, or betray them, until the Day of Judgment".</p>
 
<p>Imam Ahmad Rahimahullah said regarding this Hadith: "If there are not the people of Hadith and the scholars of Hadith, then I don't know who else they could be"</p>
